# Unacronymer

Created by Jared Casasrly, Nick Kettler, and Sandy Jiang

The Unacronymer is a CGI script that utilizes Python to translate Acronyms written in a piece of text into 
that words defined by the acronym.  This conversion is accomplished by finding patterns in the original 
text where the acronym is in parentheses next to the definition.  All instances of the acronym are then 
replaced when viewed in the output of the CGI script
